What's needed...
- Need to write a `webscrape.py` script that captures the data processes it (including with subevents like Maid Cafe going into 45-min block options), and tidies it into a csv.
- After the csv is fully ready, manually utility score the information.
- With the data prepped, write the LP model.
- After the LP model is defined, then write the code.
- Run and observe results in an itinery.
- Make refinements to the LP model.
